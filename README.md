# AudioNet - Winter Project Electrical Engineer's Association IIT Kanpur

This repository contains the work done during the **Winter Project: AudioNet**, focusing on **audio signal processing, feature extraction, and deep learning-based classification**. The project covers various aspects of **audio classification** using **CNNs,RNNs, LSTMs**.

## Project Structure

- **Audio_Signal_Analysis**: Understanding Fourier Transform, STFT, and spectrograms for analyzing audio signals.
- **Preprocessing_and_Feature_Extraction_Techniques**: Applying noise reduction, normalization, and extracting features like MFCCs, chroma features, and spectral features.
- **UrbanSound8KDataset_Classification**: Training models on the UrbanSound8K dataset to classify environmental sounds.
- **Musical_Instrument_Classification**: Using deep learning (CNN + LSTM and explored VGG16, EfficientNetB1) for musical instrument classification.

## Models Used
- **Custom CNN + LSTM** for sequential audio classification.
- **Pretrained Models**: VGG16, EfficientNetB1 for feature extraction and classification.

## Results & Findings
- Successfully classified **musical instruments** and **environmental sounds** with high accuracy.
- Feature extraction techniques significantly improved model performance.
